# EvaGLib
EvaGLib is a project with many resources I get from a lot of sources or I created for my project. The purpose of this project is to share resources to the community and regroup my resources for game jam. I will try to refind all sources of resources. Please enjoy this lib and create the best game for your friends with it !
